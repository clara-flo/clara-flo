### In brief
- 🌱 I recently graduated with a Master’s degree in Physics from the École Normale Supérieure de Lyon.
- 👀 I’m working in the field of ultrafast optics.
- ✨ I’m interested in collaborating on projects focused on making science accessible to each and everyone.


### What you will find on my page
- Simulations and optimization.
- Coding "step by step" for interactive learning.
- Vulgarization contents.


### About me
- I'm driven by curiosity, and I love exploring different fields—whether it’s physics, biology, complex systems, or even sociology. I’m always eager to see where new questions lead me.
- I believe in the open exchange of knowledge and am a strong advocate for open-source contributions.  Whether it’s sharing code, research, or simply breaking down complex ideas, I'm eager to contribute to a community where curiosity and collaboration lead the way.
- I’m also dedicated to scientific communication, viewing the process of making complex concepts accessible as vital for both scientists and learners. By breaking down intricate ideas into clear, engaging, and relatable explanations, science communication bridges the gap between experts and the public, demystifying science and fostering broader interest and understanding.


Enjoy !
